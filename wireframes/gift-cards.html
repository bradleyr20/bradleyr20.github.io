          <p class="faq-question">Do gift cards expire?</p>
          <p>USHG gift cards do not expire, but New York State considers any gift card with zero activity 5 years after purchase as Unclaimed Property. To comply with the law, we’re required to remit these funds to New York State. For additional information regarding unclaimed property, please visit the New York State Comptroller’s website.  If your gift card is showing a zero balance or you’ll soon have 5 years with zero activity, please e-mail giftcards@ushg.com and we’ll be in touch within 2 business days.</p>
